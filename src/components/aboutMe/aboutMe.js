            Iâ€™m Bram, a <span id="spanBlue">FullStack Web Developer </span> that
            recently graduated from the University of Washington's Coding
            Bootcamp.

            During my bootcamp experience, I had the opportunity to learn and
            work with a variety of languages, frameworks, and tools including
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, JQuery, Express.js, Node.js, and more.
            I also gained experience in agile development methodologies and
            collaborative project management, both of which I believe are
            crucial skills for any developer. I'm eager to take the skills and
            knowledge that I've gained and apply them to real-world projects.
            Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or inquiries!
